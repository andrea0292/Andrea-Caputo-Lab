This course covers advanced mathematical models and methods applied to theoretical physics. Topics included are Hilbert spaces, Fourier Series, Fourier Transforms, theory of distributions, partial differential equations.
Some useful texts are:
1. For Fourier Series and Transforms: Ronald Bracewell - The Fourier Transform and Its Applications; Silverman, Richard A.Tolstov, Georgii Pavlovich - Fourier Series.
2. Partial differential equations: Sommerfeld - Partial Differential Equations in Physics; Nakhle H. Asmar - Partial Differential Equations with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems.
3. General books: R. Courant, D. Hilbert - Methods of Mathematical Physics; Jon Mathews, Robert L. Walker - Mathematical Methods of Physics (based on Feynman's course at Caltech); A. N. Kolmogorov: Elements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis.
