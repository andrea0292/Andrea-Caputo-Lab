        ## About Me

        Hi, I'm **Andrea Caputo**, an Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics at Sapienza University in Rome, and Senior Fellow at CERN-TH, specializing in:
        
        - **Dark matter detection** using both direct and indirect techniques.
        - **Supernova and Neutron Stars** as an arena for studying new particles.
        - **Galactic Dynamics** with Fuzzy Dark Matter.
        - **Cosmological Simulations** with different dark matter models.

        Iâ€™m passionate about exploring the universe through simulations and analytical models. You can check my [iNSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1498218?ui-citation-summary=true) profile to see what my research is about more in detail.
