summary: Our idea to detect wave dark matter using its conversion in the ionosphere was recently published in PRL. Congrats to Carl, PhD student with Sebastian in Geneva, who did a great job in this paper and is now on the job market!

## Overview

If dark matter (DM) is composed by very light bosons, in the presence of a dilute plasma, it can resonantly convert into photons when the DM mass matches the plasma frequency. We have studied this phenomenon in the Earth's ionosphere and proposed to build a new, small experiment to detect a possible signal!
