bio: >
  I am an Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics at Sapienza University of Rome and a Senior Fellow at CERN Theory Division in Geneva.  
  I earned my Master's degree in Theoretical Physics from Sapienza University in 2016, followed by a PhD at the University of Valencia under the supervision of Prof. Pilar Hernandez, supported by a Marie Curie Fellowship.  
  Afterward, I spent two enriching years in Israel at Tel Aviv University and the Weizmann Institute before joining CERN Theory Division in November 2022.  
  As of November 2024, I hold my current position at my alma mater, Sapienza University of Rome.  
  My research focuses on dark matter and physics beyond the Standard Model, with a strong emphasis on leveraging astrophysics and cosmology to uncover the universe's fundamental properties.
